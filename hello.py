#This simple example shows on how to call a Variable for ex: the VB here is Eddy & his age 
students_names = "Eddy" #<-- This is a string (a plain text)
students_age = 21 #Numbers don't need quotes

print("They was a student  of  at UCLL named " + students_names + ",")# so to not change his name manually we create a VB for it 
print("he is a young blood at age of 21 yrs old ")# And for his age too so we do it at same time or quicker xD
print("He likes on how people call him " + students_names + ",")
print("and he also likes being " + students_age + ",")
